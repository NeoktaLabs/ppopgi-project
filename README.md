# Ppopgi (뽑기)

Ppopgi is a transparent, on-chain raffle platform built on **Etherlink (Tezos L2)**.
It enables anyone to create and participate in single-winner raffles using verifiable randomness,
with clear rules, immutable logic, and user-owned funds.

The system is composed of three independent parts:
- **Smart contracts** (lotteries, registry, fees, randomness)
- **Frontend application** (user interface only)
- **Finalizer bot** (liveness automation)

All components are open-source and verifiable on-chain.
No simulated activity, no hidden rules, and no custodial control over user funds.

📄 Detailed documentation is available in the `/docs` folder.
